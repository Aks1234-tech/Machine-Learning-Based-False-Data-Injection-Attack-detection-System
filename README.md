# Machine-Learning-Based-False-Data-Injection-Attack-detection-System
A Python-based application designed to proactively identify and mitigate false data injection attacks in real-time systems. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, this system analyzes historical data patterns to detect anomalies indicative of malicious tampering.
Installation and Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Aks1234-tech/Machine-Learning-Based-False-Data-Injection-Attack-detection-System

Install dependencies: cd Machine-Learning-Based-False-Data-Injection-Attack-detection-System
                         pip install -r requirements.txt

Download a Dataset from Kaggle:

a. Search for a relevant dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedamineferrag/edgeiiotset-cyber-security-dataset-of-iot-iiot).
b. If the downloaded dataset is in a compressed format (e.g., .zip, .tar.gz), extract it using a tool like unzip or tar.

Configure settings: Modify the configuration file for data sources and algorithms.

Run the system: Execute the main script to start the detection process.
